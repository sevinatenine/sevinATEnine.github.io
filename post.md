Recently, I purchased an NES of eBay for around $85, including shipping and tax. When I tried it, there were wavy lines down the screen. The video quality was very poor and needed to be fixed.



I began by disassembling the NES until I found the RF/Video module. Then, I unsoldered the main capacitor for the video output and soldered in a new one, in hopes that this would fix it. After reassembling and testing, the video output was only slightly better and there were still wavy lines down the screen.



I realized that it was most likely not a capacitor problem and probably a power problem. After connecting the power input to my power supply, the video became significantly better. You could now use it, without hurting your eyes.
